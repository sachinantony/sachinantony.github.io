					<p>I am a people-person. Coding gives the kid in me the excitement of solving a puzzle. The priceless satisfaction of seeing my code solve a problem keeps me going. Each task is like a new level in the game I am playing. I wish to solve new challenges every day. </p>
					<p>For two years I worked as a web developer for Enviance Inc., a leader in cloud-based Environment, Health, Safety (EHS) software. I did my Master's at The University Cincinnati during which, I interned at Votem Corp for 6 months. Currently, I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Ford through Altimetrik Corp.</p>
          <p>More than my skills in technologies I have in my arsenal, ADAPTABILITY is what I offer. No matter what the technology is, I'll be up and running in no time and I'll make sure that the job is done on time.</p>

					<p>Census Income Prediction uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether income of an individual exceeds $50K/year based on census data.The census data contains attributes like age, education, occupation, capital gain,capital loss, hours-per-week and based on these attributes we need to predict if the income ofthe individual exceeds $50K per year. The implementation is based on NBTree algorithm. We show that in some larger databases, the accuracy of Naive-Bayes does not scaleup as well as decision trees. NBTree which induces a fusion of decision-tree classifiers and NaïveBayes classifiers i.e., the decision-tree nodes contain univariate splits as regular decision-trees,but the leaves contain Naive-Bayesian classifiers.</p>
