					<p> Formerly called as Razorthink Software, High Peak is in the business of helping customers execute their custom software development projects. While there is no shortage of outsourced software development companies, there is a dearth of companies which execute this process in a qualitative manner. The customers would typically be mid to small sized companies who are averse to building out their own internal software development teams out of either cost or management factors. </p>
