While there is no shortage of outsourced software development companies, there is a dearth of companies which execute this process in a qualitative manner. The customers would typically be mid to small sized companies who are averse to building out their own internal software development teams out of either cost or management factors. I worked on the following projects in the company:</p>

					<span class ="heading-big"> Census Income Prediction</span>
					<p>Census Income Prediction uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether income of an individual exceeds $50K/year based on census data.The census data contains attributes like age, education, occupation, capital gain,capital loss, hours-per-week and based on these attributes we need to predict if the income ofthe individual exceeds $50K per year. The implementation is based on NBTree algorithm. We show that in some larger databases, the accuracy of Naive-Bayes does not scaleup as well as decision trees. NBTree which induces a fusion of decision-tree classifiers and NaïveBayes classifiers i.e., the decision-tree nodes contain univariate splits as regular decision-trees,but the leaves contain Naive-Bayesian classifiers.</p>
