					<p> Formerly called as Razorthink Software, High Peak is in the business of helping customers execute their custom software development projects.

The customers would typically be mid to small sized companies who are averse to building out their own internal software development teams out of either cost or management factors. I worked on the following projects in the company:</p>

					<p>A blockchain implementation using Twitter as a platform. We want to achieve consensus on a set of transactions tweeted by a set of users, being validated by a set of node users and the blockchain represented by a blockchain master user. The blockchain master will be the one who will be adding transaction which has reached consensus to the block and the blocks to the blockchain.</p>

					<span class ="heading-big"> Census Income Prediction</span>
					<p>Census Income Prediction uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether income of an individual exceeds $50K/year based on census data.The census data contains attributes like age, education, occupation, capital gain,capital loss, hours-per-week and based on these attributes we need to predict if the income ofthe individual exceeds $50K per year. The implementation is based on NBTree algorithm. We show that in some larger databases, the accuracy of Naive-Bayes does not scaleup as well as decision trees. NBTree which induces a fusion of decision-tree classifiers and NaïveBayes classifiers i.e., the decision-tree nodes contain univariate splits as regular decision-trees,but the leaves contain Naive-Bayesian classifiers.</p>
